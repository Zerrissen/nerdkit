###### This is a tool developed purely for my own learning and fun purposes, and is not intended for commercial use. Use at your own risk. ######

## Installation
Download the latest release .zip file, extract, and run nerdkit.exe

Note that when you run for the first time, it may start slightly slower as I haven't signed this file yet so Defender and/or Smartscreen will kick in.

## Usage
Nerdkit is a very simple TUI - Text User Interface.
You can navigate through options using the arrow keys (navigate), space bar (multi-choice), and enter (select) key.

After opening the program, press Enter to start nerdkit

You can then use the arrow keys to select what category of tools you'd like to use, you can also start typing to filter out the options.

The specific tools will then be listed for you to be able to use.

Example output of NetTest (collection of Windows 10 utilities running at once).
Note that some tools such as NetTest output results to a log file found in the reports directory under the some directory as the nerdkit.exe file.

## Still confused?
Then you're a little simple. Just give it a run, I promise it's not that complicated.
