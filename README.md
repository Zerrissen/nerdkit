###### This is a tool developed purely for my own learning and fun purposes, and is not intended for commercial use. Use at your own risk. ######

## Installation
Download the latest release .zip file, extract, and run nerdkit.exe

Note that when you run for the first time, it may start slightly slower as I haven't signed this file yet so Defender and/or Smartscreen will kick in.

## Usage
Nerdkit is a very simple TUI - Text User Interface.
You can navigate through options using the arrow keys (navigate), space bar (multi-choice), and enter (select) key.

Eventually I'll get to uploading images and GIFs to this readme to help the extra slow people out.

## Still confused?
Then you're a little simple. Just give it a run, I promise it's not that complicated.
